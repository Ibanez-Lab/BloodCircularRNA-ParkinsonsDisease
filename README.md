# Circulating blood circular RNA in Parkinson’s Disease; from involvement in pathology to diagnostic tools in at-risk individuals | Beric et al.
We aimed to identify circRNAs associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) by leveraging 1,848 participants and 1,789 circRNA from two of the largest publicly available studies with longitudinal clinical and blood transcriptomic data. To comprehensively understand changes in circRNA we performed a cross-sectional study utilizing the last visit of each participant (N=1,848), and a longitudinal (mix model) analysis that included 1,166 participants with at least two time points. We identified 192 circRNAs differentially expressed in PD participants compared to healthy controls, with effects that were sustained during disease, in mutation carriers, and diverse ancestry. Finally, we leveraged the 192 circRNA to distinguish between PD and healthy participants with a ROC AUC of 0.797. We further showed that 71 circRNA were sufficient to distinguish between genetic PD and healthy controls (AUC=0.950) and at-risk participants and healthy controls (AUC=0.929), supporting that circRNAs have the potential to aid the diagnosis of PD. Overall, we demonstrated that circRNAs play an important role in PD and can be clinically relevant to improve PD diagnostic.
